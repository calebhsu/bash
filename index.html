      <h1>Dear Bash,</h1>
      <h3>Though best learned on a Linux-based machine,</h3>
      <p>I've come to appreciate how cool I look typing things into a terminal (even on Windows. Maybe especially on Windows).<br>
      Thanks for making navigation, file creation, and file removal so simple.<br>
      I don't even have to touch my mouse.<br></p>

      <!-- Navigation -->
      <h3>In order to do anything remotely useful,</h3> 
      <p>we have to know how to navigate. Correct me if I'm wrong, ok?</br>
      First off, I <em>list</em> the contents of my present directory using <b>ls</b>.<br>
      Then in order to <em>change directories</em>, I <b>cd directoryname</b>. Again, <br>
      I can now <b>ls</b> to see the contents of my new directory.</p>
      <p>Some time-saving shortcuts:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>pwd: displays the <em>present working directory</em> (in case I ever get lost)</li>
          <li>cd ~: change to home directory</li>
          <li>cd /: change to root directory</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>To <strong>cd</strong> multiple levels, simply duplicate the path name: <br>
      <code>cd directory/nextlevel</code><br>
      Or if moving outwards, replace each name in the path with ..<br>
      <code>cd ../.</code><br>
      Did I get that right?
      </p>

      <!-- Creation & Removal -->
      <h3>Onto something potentially dangerous...</h3>
      <p>...creating and removing directories and files. Really creation is the simple part, it's <br>
      removal that could potentially get sticky. <br>
      <em>Make a new directory</em> using <strong>mkdir directoryname</strong>. I know now I can <strong>ls</strong> to make sure it's there. <br>
      But what if I want the power to delete stuff? Well. I love and hate how hard you've made it to delete, Bash. <br>
      <em>Remove a directory</em> using <strong>rmdir directoryname</strong>. And it'll be gone, no warning or anything...if it's already an empty directory. But if it's full, <br>
      I have to go in and delete the contents. Which, granted I can do with some fancy flags but...<br>
      ...I can never remember them. It's ok, I'm content doing that throught the UI anyways.</p>
      <p>How's about files? Also simple. Just watch what you're removing.<br>
      <em>Create a file</em> using <strong>touch filename</strong>. Don't forget the extension ending!<br>
      <em>Remove a file</em> using <strong>rm filename</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>Renaming can be a little confusing due to naming conventions--<br>
      just remember that <strong>mv</strong> does <u>not</u> stand for "move directory". Instead, <br>
      <em>rename files</em> using <strong>mv oldname newname</strong>. <br>
      Gloriously few clicks. Like I said, thanks Bash!
