        <h2>Dear Bash,</h2>

        <!-- About -->
        <h3 id="about">Though best learned on a Linux-based machine,</h3>
        <p>I've come to appreciate how cool I look typing things into a terminal <br>
        (even on Windows. Maybe especially on Windows).<br>
        Thanks for making navigation, file creation, and file removal so simple.<br>
        I don't even have to touch my mouse.<br></p>

        <!-- Navigation -->
        <h3 id="nav">In order to do anything remotely useful,</h3> 
        <p>we have to know how to navigate. Correct me if I'm wrong, ok?</br>
        First off, I <em>list</em> the contents of my present directory using <b>ls</b>.<br>
        Then in order to <em>change directories</em>, I <b>cd directoryname</b>. Again, <br>
        I can now <b>ls</b> to see the contents of my new directory.</p>
        <p>Some time-saving shortcuts:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>pwd: displays the <em>present working directory</em> (in case I ever get lost)</li>
            <li>cd ~: change to home directory</li>
            <li>cd /: change to root directory</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>To <strong>cd</strong> multiple levels, simply duplicate the path name: <br>
        <code>cd directory/nextlevel</code><br>
        Or if moving outwards, replace each name in the path with ..<br>
        <code>cd ../.</code><br>
        Did I get that right?
        </p>

        <!-- Creation & Removal -->
        <h3 id="create">Onto something potentially dangerous...</h3>
        <p>...creating and removing directories and files. Really creation is the simple part, it's <br>
        removal that could potentially get sticky. <br>
        <em>Make a new directory</em> using <strong>mkdir directoryname</strong>. I know now I can <strong>ls</strong> to make sure it's there. <br>
        But what if I want the power to delete stuff? Well. I love and hate how hard you've made it to delete, Bash. <br>
        <em>Remove a directory</em> using <strong>rmdir directoryname</strong>. And it'll be gone, no warning or anything...if it's already an empty directory. But if it's full, <br>
        I have to go in and delete the contents. Which, granted I can do with some fancy flags but...<br>
        ...I can never remember them. It's ok, I'm content doing that throught the UI anyways.</p>
        <p>How's about files? Also simple. Just watch what you're removing.<br>
        <em>Create a file</em> using <strong>touch filename</strong>. Don't forget the extension ending!<br>
        <em>Remove a file</em> using <strong>rm filename</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Renaming can be a little confusing due to naming conventions--<br>
        just remember that <strong>mv</strong> does <u>not</u> stand for "move directory". Instead, <br>
        <em>rename files</em> using <strong>mv oldname newname</strong>. <br>
        Gloriously few clicks. Like I said, thanks Bash!
        </p>

        <!-- Reading Contents -->
        <h3 id="read">What if I want to read the file</h3>
        <p>without actually opening it? Don't worry Bash that was a rhetorical question. I know the answer: <br>
        If I have a <em>short file</em>, I can <strong>cat filename</strong> to output its contents into the terminal. <br>
        If I have a <em>longer file</em> though, I can <strong>less filename</strong> (totally not intuitive) to output its contents into the terminal.
        </p>

        <h3>The frightening thing</h3>
        <p>is that all of that is only the tip of your iceberg. What. I wonder if there are Bash experts out there who can rattle off these commands from the top of their head, flags and all. <br>
        I hate to break it to you Bash, but I'm content getting to know you to this extent. <br>
        Let's remain good acquaintances.</p>
